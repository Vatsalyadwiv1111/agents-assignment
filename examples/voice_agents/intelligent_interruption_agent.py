"""
Intelligent Interruption Handling Agent Example

This example demonstrates the intelligent interruption handling feature that
distinguishes between backchanneling (passive acknowledgements like "yeah", "ok", "hmm")
and real interruptions when the agent is speaking.

Key behaviors:
1. When agent is SPEAKING and user says "yeah/ok/hmm" -> Agent continues speaking (IGNORE)
2. When agent is SPEAKING and user says "wait/stop/no" -> Agent stops (INTERRUPT)
3. When agent is SILENT and user says "yeah/ok" -> Agent responds (RESPOND)
4. Mixed input like "yeah wait a second" -> Agent stops (contains interrupt keyword)

Configuration options:
- intelligent_interruption_enabled: Enable/disable the feature (default: True)
- backchanneling_words: Custom set of words to ignore while speaking
- interrupt_keywords: Words that always trigger interruption
- max_backchanneling_words: Max words to consider as backchanneling (default: 3)

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a curious explorer who set out on a journey.
The explorer traveled through dense forests, across wide rivers, and over tall mountains.
Along the way, they encountered many challenges that tested their courage and wisdom.

The explorer met interesting characters who shared valuable lessons about life and perseverance.
Each encounter brought new insights and strengthened the explorer's resolve to continue.
Through all the difficulties, the explorer never gave up hope.
